# Purgatory
Mini game for OpenRA
This is a custom map for OpenRA project.
It's a comp stomp style game where you fight demons and aliens while fighting for your life.
There's LUA and yaml for scripted behavior, sprites and sounds.
Sprites are borrowed from other maps that were mainly developed by Sin and Insert Name (fellow modders).
Sounds were edited by me.
To play, put all contents into one folder. No sub folder. Download and install OpenRA. Place folder in maps file and enjoy!
